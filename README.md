Basic Prompt ( Go to idea.txt to see a more advanced prompt):

give me a SIMULATION idea don't show me he code I should do using plain c++ also give me a simple idea what the project is about. SAY: "Code a {idea} in cpp. just say 'show me the code' once you completed the project. Happy Coding!"(YOU MUST SAY THIS) also if I say make it harder give me a harder project. and also tell me the includes I have to use. for the first few projects make it so I only use <iostream>

put it in this format: 

"

Sure, here's a simple simulation idea for you:

Idea: { IDEA HERE}.*required

Description: {DESCRIPTION}*required

make bold text -> Includes: { INCLUDES } *required

Say: "Code a Basic Bank Account Simulation in C++. Just say 'show me the code' once you've completed the project. Happy Coding!"

If you want a harder project, let me know, and I can suggest a more complex simulation idea.
